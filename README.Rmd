`sistmr` is an R package, hosted on GitHub, containing functions common to the members of the [SISTM](https://www.bordeaux-population-health.center/les-equipes/statistiques-pour-la-medecine-translationnelle-sistm/) members.

# Philosophy

This package contains functions used by one or more team members. It makes it possible to gather in the same repository R codes useful to different members of the team and to host the latest version of these codes.

# In practice

## GitHub

To be able to contribute, you must:

- create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/)

- ask to be part of the SISTM "organization" : https://github.com/sistm

- clone git repository https://github.com/sistm/sistmr (for example, from Rstudio : New project > Version control > Git, advise the deposit address in "Repository URL" then "Create project").

For more information on using Git and GitHub, see Chapter 2 of [https://r-dev-perf.borishejblum.science](https://r-dev-perf.borishejblum.science/controle-de-version-avec-git-et-github-hitorique-de-changement.html).

## R code 

Once the access is configured, most of the contributions are in the `R/` folder. The procedure and recommendations are as follows: 

- THE RULE : one function = one `*.R` file !!!

- add an R file containing the R code of the function

- document the function using `roxygen` tags (for more details on the `roxygen` documentation, see section 1.3 of [https://r-dev-perf.borishejblum.science](https://r-dev-perf.borishejblum.science/construire-un-package-r.html#documenter-une-fonction)), then generate the documentation (Rstudio : Build tab > More > Document, or run `devtools::document()`).

## Consideration of changes and synchronization

The work is done locally, it must now be synchronized with the server :

- do a "commit", explaining as much as possible what you have done

- do a "push" to upload your modifications to GitHub.

Thank you for your contribution to `sistmr` :-)
